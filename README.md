My data science class assignments are included in here. I completed tasks such as cleaning data sets, running algorithms such as SVG, k-nearest algorithms, and random forest regressor to predict trends / find correlations in the dataset. 

My final project consisted of analyzing a dataset containing information regarding STEM salaries in an attempt to find common factors related to career levels and compensation packages across multiple tech oriented companies. The information obtained in this dataset has the most relevenace to STEM students
or early career employees and could directly influence when and where students decide to focus their career paths.
